# MDOAU-net
The paper is under review.

# Code files
**MDOAU-net** is defined as **my_model4** in my_model.py.  
The multi-scale feature-fusion block, dilated convolution block, offset convolution block, and attention block is also defined in my_model.py.  
Code of baseline models is in unet.py, attention_unet.py, Unet_plus_plus.py, segnet.py, and Res_net.py.  
Lee.m is an implementation of the Lee filter.  
wjc_dore.py defines the training, validating, and testing logic.  
dataprocess.py creates a data loader in Pytorch.

# How to run
Running main.py can train and test a model.
You can just train a model or test a model by denoting some codes.

# Pre-trained models
